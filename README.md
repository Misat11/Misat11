### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michal, a programmer specializing in Java and PHP. I occasionally work with other languages, such as Kotlin, Groovy, JavaScript, and maybe even your favorite language!

As a member of the [ScreamingSandals](https://github.com/ScreamingSandals) organization, I create plugins for Minecraft servers (Spigot & Paper), including the popular [Screaming BedWars](https://github.com/ScreamingSandals/BedWars). If you're into Minecraft: Java Edition servers or love minigames, feel free to explore our projects. Theyâ€™re completely free to use!
