### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Michal and I'm Java and PHP programmer. I sometimes code in other languages, like Kotlin, Groovy, or JavaScript, and maybe in your favorite language as well.

I'm a member of the ScreamingSandals organization, where I work on plugins for Minecraft servers, notably Screaming BedWars. If you are interested
in Minecraft: Java Edition servers and especially minigames, go check it out, it's completely free.
